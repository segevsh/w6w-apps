# Mistral AI

Chat completions, embeddings, and OCR via the Mistral AI API.

- **Categories** — ai
- **Auth methods** — api-key
- **Actions** — 4
- **Egress allowlist** — `api.mistral.ai`

## Health check

Three different questions get confused with each other, so this section keeps them
apart: is the *vendor* up, is *this credential* live, and do we have *quota* left. Only
the second is something the app itself performs.

### Is the vendor up?

**Service status** — feed only.

```
GET https://status.mistral.ai/feed.rss
```

The page itself is Checkly-hosted and exposes no JSON rollup; the RSS feed is the
machine-readable surface.

### Is this credential live?

This is what the Auth `test` hook does — the app's own health check, and the only one of
the three it performs itself.

The single auth method probes:

```
GET /v1/models
```

Lists models. Free, unlike any completion call.

Nothing in this app calls that endpoint: it is out-of-band context for whoever is
diagnosing a failure, and the host it lives on is not in `w6w.network.allow`, so an
action could not reach it even if it tried.

### Do we have quota left?

`x-ratelimit-limit` / `-remaining` / `-reset` response headers, metered per minute in
both requests and tokens.

## Declared health checks

Per [`rfcs/healthcheck.md`](https://github.com/w6w-io/w6w-core/blob/main/rfcs/healthcheck.md).
The three questions above map onto declared checks like this:

| Key | Kind | Scope | Credential | Severity | Min interval | Probe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `service` | service | app | none | degraded | 300s | `health/service.ts` |
| `quota` | quota | connection | signed | informational | 300s | `health/quota.ts` |
| `auth:api-key` | credential | connection | signed | fatal | — | derived from the `api-key` auth method's `test` hook |

The host `status.mistral.ai` (for `service`) is reachable **only inside that hook's worker** — not from any action, and not from the other
checks. The spec allows the widening precisely because the check is unsigned; pairing an
extra host with `credential: "signed"` is rejected at load time, so a credential can never
reach a status host.

Researched and endpoint-verified 2026-07-26. Status surfaces move; re-check with
`_tools/audit.ts` conventions in mind if a probe starts failing for everyone at once.
