## Health check

Three different questions get confused with each other, so this section keeps them
apart: is the *vendor* up, is *this credential* live, and do we have *quota* left. Only
the second is something the app itself performs.

### Is the vendor up?

**Service status** — machine-readable.

```
GET https://www.google.com/appsstatus/dashboard/incidents.json
```

See the Workspace Status Dashboard note above.

### Is this credential live?

This is what the Auth `test` hook does — the app's own health check, and the only one of
the three it performs itself.

The auth methods probe different endpoints:

| Auth method | Probe |
|---|---|
| `oauth2` | `GET /about?fields=user` |
| `service-account` | `POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token (JWT grant)` |

Drive's own whoami. `fields=user` is what keeps it cheap — `about` returns a large
object if you do not narrow it, and Drive rejects the call outright without a `fields`
mask.

The service-account method proves the credential by exchanging its signed JWT for an
access token — there is no user token to inspect.

Nothing in this app calls that endpoint: it is out-of-band context for whoever is
diagnosing a failure, and the host it lives on is not in `w6w.network.allow`, so an
action could not reach it even if it tried.

### Do we have quota left?

No headroom endpoint; quota is per-project and visible in the Google Cloud console.

## Declared health checks

Per [`rfcs/healthcheck.md`](https://github.com/w6w-io/w6w-core/blob/main/rfcs/healthcheck.md).
The three questions above map onto declared checks like this:

| Key | Kind | Scope | Credential | Severity | Min interval | Probe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `service` | service | app | none | degraded | 120s | `health/service.ts` |
| `quota` | quota | connection | signed | informational | — | _declared absent_ |
| `auth:oauth2` | credential | connection | signed | fatal | — | derived from the `oauth2` auth method's `test` hook |
| `auth:service-account` | credential | connection | signed | fatal | — | derived from the `service-account` auth method's `test` hook |

The host `www.google.com` (for `service`) is reachable **only inside that hook's worker** — not from any action, and not from the other
checks. The spec allows the widening precisely because the check is unsigned; pairing an
extra host with `credential: "signed"` is rejected at load time, so a credential can never
reach a status host.

**`quota` is declared absent.** Google publishes no headroom endpoint or rate-limit headers. Quota is per-project, billed in method-specific units and visible only in the Google Cloud console; exhaustion surfaces as 429 `rateLimitExceeded` or 403 `userRateLimitExceeded`.
A declared absence always reports `unknown`, so it carries `severity: "informational"` —
otherwise it would pin every verdict for this app at `unknown` forever.

Researched and endpoint-verified 2026-07-26. Status surfaces move; re-check with
`_tools/audit.ts` conventions in mind if a probe starts failing for everyone at once.
