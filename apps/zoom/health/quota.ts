/**
 * How much headroom is left on THIS credential — Zoom.
 *
 * Annotation:
 *
 *   - `kind: "quota"` — a different question from liveness. The derived `auth:*`
 *     check answers "is the credential live"; this answers "will the next
 *     hundred calls succeed".
 *   - `scope: "connection"` and `credential: "signed"` are this kind's defaults
 *     and both are correct: the allowance belongs to the credential, and reading
 *     it needs the credential on the wire. Signing is safe because the probe
 *     stays on the app's own egress allowlist — this check declares no
 *     `network.allow` of its own, which the spec forbids alongside a signed
 *     posture.
 *   - `severity: "informational"` — running low is worth showing and never worth
 *     failing a verdict over.
 *
 * Probe: `GET /v2/users/me`, the same whoami the auth `test` hook uses.
 *
 * Zoom bands endpoints into Light / Medium / Heavy / Resource-intensive
 * categories with separate daily allowances, and reports which band a response
 * belongs to in `X-RateLimit-Category`. `/users/me` is a Light call, so the
 * numbers below describe the Light band — a workflow creating meetings is
 * spending a different, smaller budget. The band is reported as the bucket id
 * rather than hidden, so a UI cannot mistake it for an account-wide figure.
