/**
 * How much headroom is left on THIS credential — SendGrid.
 *
 * Annotation:
 *
 *   - `kind: "quota"` — a different question from liveness. The derived `auth:*`
 *     check answers "is the credential live"; this answers "will the next
 *     hundred calls succeed".
 *   - `scope: "connection"` and `credential: "signed"` are this kind's defaults
 *     and both are correct: the allowance belongs to the credential, and reading
 *     it needs the credential on the wire. Signing is safe because the probe
 *     stays on the app's own egress allowlist — this check declares no
 *     `network.allow` of its own, which the spec forbids alongside a signed
 *     posture.
 *   - `severity: "informational"` — running low is worth showing and never worth
 *     failing a verdict over.
 *
 * Probe: `GET /v3/scopes`, the same call the auth `test` hook makes. It is
 * SendGrid's documented way to validate a key and it needs no scope of its own,
 * so it works for the narrowest credential a user might hand us.
