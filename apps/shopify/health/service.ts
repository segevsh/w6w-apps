/**
 * Is Shopify up? — Atlassian Statuspage.
 *
 * Annotation, and why each axis is what it is:
 *
 *   - `kind: "service"` — this answers "is the vendor's platform up", which is a
 *     different question from "is this credential live" (the derived `auth:*`
 *     check) or "is there quota left" (`quota`).
 *   - `scope: "app"` (the default for this kind) — the answer is identical for
 *     every Connection, so the host runs it once and shares the result. Running
 *     it per Connection would multiply one useful call by the number of users
 *     and is a good way to get rate-limited by a status page.
 *   - `credential: "none"` (also the default) — no Connection is supplied and
 *     `sign` never runs, so this reports even before anyone has connected.
 *   - `network.allow` — www.shopifystatus.com is deliberately NOT on the app's
 *     egress allowlist; an action has no business calling it. The allowlist is
 *     widened for this one hook only, which the spec permits precisely because
 *     the posture is unsigned: a signed request must never reach a third-party
 *     status host.
 *   - `severity` defaults to `degraded` for this kind, so a vendor incident
 *     never hard-fails a target on its own.
 *
 * `summary.json` rather than `status.json`: same single request, but it carries
 * the per-component breakdown — one probe reporting many things, which is the
 * point of a report over a boolean.
