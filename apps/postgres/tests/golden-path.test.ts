/**
 * T2.1.2's proof case: drives `@w6w/runtime`'s `invoke()` (and, for the
 * health check, the same `openConnectionSocket` + `runHook` primitives
 * `invoke()` itself composes) against the devcontainer's REAL `postgres`
 * compose service — real DNS resolution, a real `Deno.connect`, real
 * SCRAM-SHA-256. No mock, no fake listener: `tests/actions/*.test.ts` and
 * `tests/health/service.test.ts` already prove the app's own logic against
 * hand-built wire fixtures; this file is the independent oracle that a real
 * PostgreSQL 16 server actually accepts what this app sends and rejects what
 * it should.
 *
 * ## `allowPrivate: true` — not a workaround
 *
 * `Deno.resolveDns("postgres", "A")` resolves to `172.20.0.5`, RFC 1918
 * private space (measured at this node's planning time — see this node's
 * contract, "Context" section). That is expected: this is the "legitimate
 * for a self-hosted deployment reaching its own co-located DB, but never
 * implicit" case the intake's F-1 item 3 committed to, exercised for real
 * here — not something a later reader should "clean up" by trying to make
 * the target look public.
 *
 * ## Write discipline
 *
 * The devcontainer's `postgres` service is the shared dev database. Every
 * statement below is either `SELECT`-only or `CREATE TEMP TABLE` (visible
 * only to the session that created it, gone when that socket closes) — never
 * `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` against anything that existed
 * before this file ran. `deno task e2e` (a `server` task, a different
 * boundary entirely) is never invoked here.
 *
 * ## One session per `invoke()`
 *
 * A temp table created in one `invoke()` is gone by the next — the socket
 * closes with the invocation (T1.2.2's `finally`). So (e)'s create+insert+
 * select-back all happen inside ONE multi-statement `sql` value, and the
 * isolation test below deliberately tries to see that same temp table from
 * a SECOND `invoke()`, expecting it to be gone.
