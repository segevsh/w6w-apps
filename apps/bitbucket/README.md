## Health check

Three different questions get confused with each other, so this section keeps them
apart: is the *vendor* up, is *this credential* live, and do we have *quota* left. Only
the second is something the app itself performs.

### Is the vendor up?

**Service status** — <https://bitbucket.status.atlassian.com>

```
GET https://bitbucket.status.atlassian.com/api/v2/status.json
```

Atlassian Statuspage. `GET /api/v2/status.json` gives a one-line rollup
(`status.indicator` is `none` / `minor` / `major` / `critical`); `/api/v2/summary.json`
adds per-component detail and open incidents; `/api/v2/components.json` lists the
components on their own. All three are unauthenticated, CORS-enabled and cheap enough to
poll.

### Is this credential live?

This is what the Auth `test` hook does — the app's own health check, and the only one of
the three it performs itself.

All 2 auth methods probe:

```
GET /2.0/user
```

The authenticated user. Note it needs the `account` scope — an app password created
without it 403s here even though repository calls work, so a failure is not necessarily
a dead credential.

Nothing in this app calls that endpoint: it is out-of-band context for whoever is
diagnosing a failure, and the host it lives on is not in `w6w.network.allow`, so an
action could not reach it even if it tried.

### Do we have quota left?

`X-RateLimit-Limit` / `-Remaining` / `-Reset` response headers.

## Declared health checks

Per [`rfcs/healthcheck.md`](https://github.com/w6w-io/w6w-core/blob/main/rfcs/healthcheck.md).
The three questions above map onto declared checks like this:

| Key | Kind | Scope | Credential | Severity | Min interval | Probe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `service` | service | app | none | degraded | 60s | `health/service.ts` |
| `quota` | quota | connection | signed | informational | 300s | `health/quota.ts` |
| `auth:basic` | credential | connection | signed | fatal | — | derived from the `basic` auth method's `test` hook |
| `auth:access-token` | credential | connection | signed | fatal | — | derived from the `access-token` auth method's `test` hook |

The host `bitbucket.status.atlassian.com` (for `service`) is reachable **only inside that hook's worker** — not from any action, and not from the other
checks. The spec allows the widening precisely because the check is unsigned; pairing an
extra host with `credential: "signed"` is rejected at load time, so a credential can never
reach a status host.

Researched and endpoint-verified 2026-07-26. Status surfaces move; re-check with
`_tools/audit.ts` conventions in mind if a probe starts failing for everyone at once.
